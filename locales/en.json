It is an obligatory place to visit if you are passing through Trinidad, it constitutes not only the center of many important buildings but also for its historical significance. One seems to be going back in time to colonial times and see the carriages and the ladies and black slaves in chains. Since the idea of ​​urbanizing the Villa began, this site was chosen to be the square. The Old Parish Mayor is the one who gave it importance and that is why in its beginnings it was called Plaza de la Iglesia. It is one of the most important places in the city, not only for its history, but for its location, all the streets lead to it, the mansions around it provoke the curiosity of visitors who come to this city also called the museum city of Cuba or the City stopped in time. You can admire the colonial architecture, explore local shops, and immerse yourself in the cultural richness of the area. Around the square are several mansions that were once the home of the wealthiest families of the colonial era, today converted into city museums. There is the Iglesia Mayor Santísima Trinidad, the most important building among all, with a history of collapse and reconstruction and that has suffered the attacks of cyclones and storms, the attacks of corsairs and pirates and is currently one of the largest and oldest churches from the country. There is also the Municipal Historical Museum, the Museum of Architecture, the Romantic Museum, located in the old Brunet Palace, one of the most important in the country, which exhibits the decoration and furniture of the wealthy families of the Trinitarian golden stage. There is also the Ortiz Palace, today the Trinidad Art Gallery, and the San Francisco de Asís Convent. What makes Trinity Square unique is the four symmetrical rectangles, they are like small white trellised gardens with fine filigree, brought from Philadelphia and in all of them there are planted two royal palms, a symbol of the Cuban nation. The rectangles delimit the interior and exterior spaces of the square. The so-called Bremese faience distinguishes the rest of the area. In the center is the marble sculpture of the goddess Terpsichore, the muse of dance, but the welcome to the square is given by two cast iron greyhounds, brought from the Quinta de Don Justo Germán Cantero, an illustrious Trinitarian landowner and intellectual of the century XIX. The two wells built in 1868 are preserved intact, as well as the decorative ceramic cups, the iron benches and the streetlights that illuminated the space."

Known as the first park in San Francisco, it predates both Washington Square (1847) and Union Square (1850) [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth_Square). \nOriginally established in the early 19th century during the period of Mexican California, the plaza was renamed following the U.S. Conquest of California in honor of the USS Portsmouth, the American ship which captured the city [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth_Square). \nOver the years, the square has played host to numerous events and milestones. It was the site of the first public school in California in 1847, and the announcement of the discovery of gold in 1848 drew thousands of prospectors to the city [Source 2](https://www.kqed.org/news/11787679/the-rich-history-of-san-franciscos-first-plaza). \nDuring the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, Portsmouth Square served as a temporary tent city for displaced residents and temporary gravesite [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth_Square). \nToday, San Francisco Square continues to be a bustling community hub, particularly for the local Chinese community. It offers a snapshot of the city's rich history and serves as a meeting point for people from all walks of life [Source 2](https://www.kqed.org/news/11787679/the-rich-history-of-san-franciscos-first-plaza)."

It was founded on December 5, 1887 with the purpose of increasing recreational options for national and foreign tourism. Although it began to develop as a summer resort in the 1940s, in the last 10 years its hotel network and non-hotel offering have experienced unprecedented growth. One of the main activities you can do at the Varadero dolphinarium is to attend one of the two dolphin shows that take place at 9:00 in the morning and 5 in the afternoon. Additionally, you can choose to participate in the bath and show with dolphins. The Varadero Dolphinarium has a large pool where the dolphins perform their shows. Around a dozen dolphins, literally adorable, perform four shows a day with large crowds. In addition, you can choose to take a 15-minute dive next to the dolphins. For children, there is a children's recreation park on site with other offers that will make them enjoy their visit. Finally, the environment surrounding the dolphinarium is full of natural riches that you can enjoy, such as caves, escarpments, a string of virgin and easily accessible keys, and a characteristic natural landscape."
